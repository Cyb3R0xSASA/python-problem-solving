# **Solution to Greatest Common Divisor of Strings**

This is my solution to the *"Greatest Common Divisor of Strings"* problem from LeetCode.

## **Problem Link:**
[Greatest Common Divisor of Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/greatest-common-divisor-of-strings/solutions/6091172/it-taken-43min-i-vote-its-medium-not-easy)

## **Problem Statement:**
Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, we say "`t` divides `s`" if and only if `s = t + t + ... + t` (i.e., `t` is concatenated with itself one or more times). Return the largest string `x` such that `x` divides both `str1` and `str2`.

### **Examples:**

#### Example 1:
**Input:**
```python
str1 = 'ABCABC'
str2 = 'ABC'
```

**Output:**
```python
'ABC'
```

#### Example 2:
**Input:**
```python
str1 = 'ABABAB'
str2 = 'ABAB'
```

**Output:**
```python
'AB'
```

#### Example 3:
**Input:**
```python
str1 = 'LEET'
str2 = 'CODE'
```

**Output:**
```python
''
```

## **Solution Approach**

### **Step 1: Check String Patterns**
- To determine if a valid common divisor exists, ensure the concatenated strings follow the same pattern.
- Use this condition:
```python
if str1 + str2 != str2 + str1:
    return ""
```
- If the condition is true, proceed; otherwise, return an empty string.

### **Step 2: Apply Euclid's Algorithm**
- Use Euclid's algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the lengths of `str1` and `str2`.
- Function implementation:
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
**Explanation:**
- The algorithm repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a % b` until `b` becomes 0.
- The value of `a` at this point is the GCD.

**Example Calculation:**
```python
# Find GCD of lengths: a = len(str1), b = len(str2)
gcd(a, b) # a = 6, b = 4
# Steps:
# a, b = 4, 6 % 4 = 4, 2
# a, b = 2, 4 % 2 = 2, 0
# Result: GCD = 2
```

### **Step 3: Extract the GCD String**
- Use the result from the GCD calculation to extract the substring:
```python
gcd_length = gcd(len(str1), len(str2))
return str1[:gcd_length]
```

**Final Output for Example 2:**
```python
str1[:2] # 'ABABAB'[:2]
# Result: 'AB'
```

## **Complexity Analysis**
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) and \(m\) are the lengths of `str1` and `str2`.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\)
