# Python Problem Solving

Welcome to my repository where I solve various problems and challenges in Python. This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to algorithmic problems, coding challenges, and exercises I have worked on.

### Problem Solving Topics:
- Algorithms
- Data Structures
- Python Programming Challenges
- LeetCode Solutions
- Coding Interview Preparation

### Repository Structure:
```
/python-problem-solving
    ├── [Problem 1 Name].py
    ├── [Problem 2 Name].py
    └── ...
    └── README.md
```

### Solution Categories:
- **LeetCode Solutions**: My solutions to various LeetCode problems.
- **Algorithms**: Solutions to various algorithm problems (sorting, searching, etc.).
- **Data Structures**: Solutions dealing with different data structures (Linked Lists, Stacks, etc.).

### Example Problem:
For each problem I solve, I create a new file and describe the problem statement, the solution approach, and the time and space complexity. Here is an example format:

#### [Problem Name Here]
**Problem Statement**:  
_Describe the problem in brief_.

**Solution Approach**:  
_Explain the approach taken to solve the problem_.

```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, input):
        # Code goes here
        pass
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n)  
**Space Complexity**: O(n)
